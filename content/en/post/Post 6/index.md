## May 19-25

**Thursday May 19th**

Thursday 12 May started with a class in my favorite subject "Calculation" at 9:00 am. To do this, I woke up at 7:00, had breakfast and went to the university. On the first pair, we wrote a control work on the topic "Power Series". On the second pair, we went through a new topic - Triple Integrals. After two pairs of mathematical analysis, we went to the dining room and had a delicious meal. Then we went to pairs in the discipline "Operating Systems". I did 10 and 11 labs and stage 4 on an individual project. A very productive day!


**Friday May 20th**

On Friday, May 13, we had a remote lecture on calculus. There were no more couples! All day long I was walking around beautiful Moscow with my friends. Was great!

**Saturday and Sunday (May 21-22)**

On Saturday we went to the theater. After the theater we went to a cafe. Had a great evening.

On Sunday I did my homework for the coming week. In the evening I went for a walk with friends.

**Monday 23 May**

On May 14, we had a lecture on the discipline "Operating Systems". On it I learned a lot of new things. After that I went to classes in English. On them, we started preparing for the exam, which will be on May 30.

**Wednesday May 25th**

On Wednesday, May 18, we had 2 seminars on Mathematical Logic. During the first session, we wrote a test. The second pair studied the complex topic "Closed classes".
