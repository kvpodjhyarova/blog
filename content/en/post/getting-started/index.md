## Short review

**one. The main thing**

One of the most famous ski resorts in Russia is located at the meeting point of the Altai Mountains with the Sayan Mountains, in Mountain Shoria. For the beauty of the relief, it is often called the Siberian Switzerland. It has everything for relaxation - from dog sledding to helicopter rides, from spa services to nightclubs. In summer, Mountain Shoria is ideal for mountain walks and excursions to caves.

**2. Story**

The name of the region came from the indigenous people, the Shors. Mountain Shoria is a region famous for iron ore deposits. Since the 19th century, iron has been mined here, as well as wood, pine nuts and fur-bearing animals. In Soviet times, the region was infamous for the huge number of Gulag institutions.

The ski resort was built in Sheregesh in 1981 for the Spartakiad of the peoples of the RSFSR, but it received the most active development only in 2000.

**3. Impression**

The phenomenon of Sheregesh is skiers in swimsuits. Winters in Sheregesh, although sunny, are frosty. In April, the temperature rises to + 10-15 degrees, the bright sun warms skiers, ski jackets quickly change into swimsuits.

In general, the resort is extremely atmospheric. Before the advent of Krasnaya Polyana, it was the most visited in Russia, and not only Siberians came here, but also residents of central Russia. Many are in love with its homely atmosphere and the hospitality of the locals and return year after year, affectionately calling Geshem.
