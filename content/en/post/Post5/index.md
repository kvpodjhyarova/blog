# Laboratory work is a small research work, which should be drawn up according to all approved requirements. When preparing a report on laboratory work, you will master a number of important elements that will later be useful to you when writing term papers and dissertations.

## Report structure

According to GOST 7.32-2001, any research work must be
contain the following elements:

- title page;

- essay;

- introduction;

- the main part;

- conclusion.

GOST also recommends that the following elements be included in the work:

- list of performers;

- content;

- Normative references;

- definitions;

- designations and abbreviations;

- list of sources used;

- applications.

If you are carrying out complex work that is carried out in several stages, then you may
you need to include part or all of the elements of the second list.

## Contents of the main elements of the report**

1. **Title page**. The first sheet of work is drawn up strictly according to the model, which is usually given in teaching aids for your subject. It not only requires specifying such elements as the name of the educational institution, type of work and information about the performer, but also arrange them in strict accordance with the standards.

2. **Abstract**. The abstract is actually a summary of your entire report and contains a number of statistical information. It must indicate the number of parts, pages of work, illustrations, applications, tables, used literary sources and applications. Here is a list of key words of the work and the actual text of the abstract. The latter implies the main elements of the work from the set goals to the results and recommendations for their implementation. In the practice of universities, the abstract is usually not included in the reports on laboratory work.

3. **Introduction**. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the ongoing research and tasks, the implementation of which will help achieve the goals, are usually prescribed. At the same time, there are works in which students become real pioneers. Have you ever experienced a feeling of extreme curiosity and impatience while doing lab work? Feel that in just a couple of minutes you will find the answer to a question that no one has ever found an answer to? It is for such studies that a detailed introduction is written with proof of the relevance and novelty of the topic under study. In order to really conduct research in an area in which, as they say, no human foot has yet set foot, in the introduction you will need to assess the current state of the problem under consideration and justify the need to solve it.

4. **Main part**. Since different universities and disciplines have their own subtleties of laboratory work, the content of the main part is described in detail in the relevant manuals. It is important that this section of the work reflects its essence, describes the methodology and results of the work done.

The main part contains the following elements:

- the purpose of the study;

- tasks, the implementation of which will help achieve the goals;

- a workflow that describes the actions performed;

- other sections provided for by the methodological materials on the studied
discipline.

5. **Conclusion**. In this part of the work, you will need to draw conclusions based on the results obtained during the laboratory work. To do this, evaluate how well the tasks have been completed. Complex works may contain other elements, for example, recommendations for further application of the results of the work carried out.
