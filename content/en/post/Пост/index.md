title: Version control. Git.
subtitle: Good afternoon! Today we will talk about the version control system.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: This chapter is about getting started with Git. Let's first learn the basics of version control systems, then move on to how to run Git on your OS and finally set it up to work. By the end of this chapter, you'll know what Git is and why you should use it, and you'll have a system that's finally set up to work.

## GIT - VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

**GIT is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of the Linux kernel and is currently very widely used in the software development environment.**

A Version Control System (VCS) is software that makes it easier to work with changing information. The version control system allows you to store multiple versions of the same document, revert to earlier versions if necessary, determine who made a change and when, and much more. Such systems are most widely used in software development to store the source codes of the program being developed.

GIT is one such system. GIT uses a distributed model instead of the traditional client-server model. Thus, GIT repositories do not need a centralized repository: the entire history of document changes is stored on each computer, in local storage, and, if necessary, individual fragments of the local storage history are synchronized with the same storage on another computer.

Today, GIT has become the standard version control system for so many developers, and GitHub source code hosting is the largest such service. Examples of projects using Git are the Linux kernel, Android, Ruby on Rails, Drupal, Wine, Chromium, Compiz Fusion, jQuery, PHP, MediaWiki, and some Linux distributions
