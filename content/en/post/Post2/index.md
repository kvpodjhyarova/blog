## May 5-12

**Thursday May 5th**

Thursday May 5th started with a class in my favorite subject "Calculus" at 9:00. To do this, I woke up at 7:00, had breakfast and went to the university. The road from my hostel to the building of the university where I study takes 1 hour. In pairs, we went through a new topic - Double Integrals. After two pairs of mathematical analysis, we went to the dining room and had a delicious meal. Then we went to pairs in the discipline "Operating Systems". I did 7 and 8 labs and stage 2 on an individual project. Returned home at 21:00.


**Friday May 6th**

On Friday, May 6, we had a remote lecture on calculus. There were no more couples! All day long I was walking around beautiful Moscow with my friends. Was great!

**Saturday and Sunday (May 7-8)**

On Saturday I went to visit my older sister Nastya in Balashikha. We had a great time talking with family and friends.

**Monday May 9th**

May 9 is a big holiday - Victory Day! We watched the parade of military equipment, went to Gorky Park and Poklonnaya Hill. There were 2 concerts in Gorky Park, various "stations" where we could plunge a little into that wartime, and they also fed us buckwheat porridge with meat. There was a big concert on Poklonnaya Hill. It was attended by stars from the CIS countries, choirs, recited poetry. At 22:00 there was fireworks, we really liked it! Happy Victory Day!!!

**Wednesday May 11th**

On Wednesday, May 11, we had 2 seminars on Mathematical Logic. We were told that we were writing a test next week. Of course, my classmates and I are very happy!
